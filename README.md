Part 1: Data Generation
First, I created a realistic dataset for a fictional manufacturing facility with three production lines. This script simulates one month of production data, including scheduled shifts, product changeovers, production output, quality defects, and various types of downtime events.

Part 2: OEE Analysis & Visualization
This script loads the generated data, calculates the OEE components for each record, and then aggregates the data to identify key insights and visualize the findings.
